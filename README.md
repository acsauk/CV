## Alex Saunders

Welcome to the CV of Alex Saunders. Maker of Things, Lover of All Things Cat Related, Solver of Problems, Enthusiast of Gadgets - the list goes on but to sum it up I guess you could say I'm a proud graduate of Makers Academy (M.A.) (link) looking for an opportunity to put to use the cool/amazing skills I've learnt over the past 12 weeks.

I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility and Cross Border compliance at a professional services firm to web development earlier this year and I haven't looked back since. Being able to start each day energised with a new challenge and work out creative and efficient ways to solve it has confirmed my suspicion that career in web development is a perfect fit for me.

As a fledgling M.A. graduate I am looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce and somewhere where I can be stretched beyond my comfort zone, make really cool things, solve fiendish problems and provide value where ever possible.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Web Development

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

I have gained a solid foundation in object orientated programming and leading industry standards such as Test Driven Development (TDD), working as part of an Agile team and following SOLID principals when writing code.

Specifically I have experience of working in Ruby and Javascript developing apps in Ruby-on-Rails and CLI level with a focus on maintainable DRY code.

##### Project Examples
| Project | Size of team | Description | Technologies |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Meal Planner |4| A Ruby-on-Rails app developed over 8 days that allows users to sign up, create recipes and make a 7 day meal plan | Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, CSS (Milligram), Rspec, Capybara, HTML |
| Dress 2 Impress | 5 | A Ruby-on-Rails app developed over 3.5 days that gives users the chance to have friends and family vote on their (sometimes dubious) fashion choices | Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, CSS (Bootstrap), Rspec, Capybara, HTML, Paperclip gem, Papercrop gem |
| Thermostatatic | 2 | A vanilla Javascript app to simulate the actions of a thermostat that consumes a weather API to display weather local to the user |  |
