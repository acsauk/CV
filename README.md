## Alex Saunders

Welcome to the CV of Alex Saunders. Maker of Things, Lover of Cat Videos, Solver of Problems, Enthusiast of Gadgets - the list goes on but to sum it up I guess you could say I'm a web developer proudly trained at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) looking for an opportunity to put to use the cool/amazing skills I've learnt over the past 16 weeks.

Having partially completed a Computing BSc degree and fostering a life-long obsession for all things tech, I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility and Cross Border compliance at EY to web development earlier this year and I haven't looked back since. Being able to start each day with a new problem and formulating creative and efficient ways to solve it has confirmed my suspicion that web development is a perfect fit for me.

I am looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce - somewhere where I can be stretched beyond my comfort zone, make really cool things and provide value where ever possible.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Web Development

I have gained a solid foundation in full stack object orientated programming and practice leading industry standards such as Test Driven Development (TDD), working as part of an Agile team and following SOLID principals when writing code.

Specifically I have experience of working in Ruby and Javascript developing apps in Ruby-on-Rails and at Command Line Interface level with a focus on maintainable DRY code.

#### Communication and Teamwork

- Working on multiple Makers Academy project teams and pair programming on a daily basis and having worked as part of a Global team at EY for the past five years in office and remote settings, I am used to building and maintaining relationships with colleagues and clients alike from a distance and face to face

- I designed and delivered multiple webcasts to groups of senior Partners based around the world while working at EY in order to educate on the complex tax and immigration issues surrounding cross border working in an easy to understand format.

#### Attention to detail

- Feedback from other students on my Makers Academy cohort highlighted my attention to detail while pairing, in particular identifying syntax errors and providing alternative approaches to code structure

- During my time at EY I was responsible for submitting visa applications and tax filing information on behalf of EY employees which also instilled in me the importance of ensuring extremely high attention to detail
