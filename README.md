## Alex Saunders

I'm a language agnostic web developer proudly trained at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) currently providing platform solutions at PM Connect.

Having fostered a life-long obsession for all things tech, I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility at EY to web development three years ago and I haven't looked back since.

The focus of my recent roles has been on platform and RESTful API development and maintaining DRY quality code through TDD/BDD and following SOLID principles. I’m looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce and prioitises the user's experience of products they create.

## Interests
