## Alex Saunders

I'm a language agnostic web developer proudly trained at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) currently providing platform solutions at PM Connect.

Having partially completed a Computing BSc degree and fostering a life-long obsession for all things tech, I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility at EY to web development three years ago and I haven't looked back since.

I am looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce - somewhere where I can be stretched beyond my comfort zone, have a positive impact on users at scale and provide value wherever possible.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Web Development
I have gained a solid foundation in full stack object orientated programming and practice industry leading standards such as Test Driven Development (TDD), working as part of an Agile team and following SOLID principles when writing code.

Specifically, I have experience of working in:

- PHP, Ruby, Go and JavaScript
- Developing apps in Symfony, Ruby-on-Rails, Node.js and AWS with a focus on maintainable DRY code.

Previous projects include:

- Integrating with Mobile carriers APIs using Symfony/PHP and Go to charge customers and send SMSs
- Building an asset library in Ruby-on-Rails that integrated into a custom PHP CMS
- Prototyping and delivering Node.js AWS Lambda scripts to parse and sanitise emails ready to be used in AWS Machine Learning to make predictions on email categories for a customer service function
- A Ruby on Rails app built in my spare time to help food businesses with their costing and recipe management

#### Fast learner
When I started at Makers Academy, one of Europe's leading web development bootcamps, I had minimal experience of object orientated programming and had never coded in Ruby or JavaScript. After an intense 16 weeks I found I was comfortable in both languages and had developed the skills to pick up new technologies and languages quickly.

Starting my current role at PM Connect required me to learn the Symfony framework and I had submitted a pull request to production code within the first week to integrate a user interaction tracking tool into an existing product.

#### Communication and Teamwork
- Being part of a team of 12 developers at PM Connect, and working in a Global function at EY in office and remote settings, I am experienced at building and maintaining relationships with colleagues and clients from a distance and face to face.
- In my “pre-coding” work life at EY I designed and delivered multiple webcasts to groups of senior Partners based around the world in order to educate on the complex tax and immigration issues surrounding cross border working in an easy to understand format.

## Interests

Aside from coding I love long distance running and try to get through at least two half marathons a year. I'm an avid gamer with a fierce loyalty towards all things Nintendo (can't get enough of my Switch right now...) and I try to indulge my passion for live music whenever possible.
