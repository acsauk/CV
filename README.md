## Alex Saunders

Welcome to the CV of Alex Saunders. Maker of Things, Lover of All Things Cat Related, Solver of Problems, Enthusiast of Gadgets - the list goes on but to sum it up I guess you could say I'm a proud graduate of Makers Academy (M.A.) (link) looking for an opportunity to put to use the cool/amazing skills I've learnt over the past 12 weeks.

I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility and Cross Border compliance at a professional services firm to web development earlier this year and I haven't looked back since. Being able to start each day energised with a new challenge and work out creative and efficient ways to solve it has confirmed my suspicion that career in web development is a perfect fit for me.

As a fledgling M.A. graduate I am looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce and somewhere where I can be stretched beyond my comfort zone, make really cool things, solve fiendish problems and provide value where ever possible.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Web Development

I have gained a solid foundation in object orientated programming and leading industry standards such as Test Driven Development (TDD), working as part of an Agile team and following SOLID principals when writing code.

Specifically I have experience of working in Ruby and Javascript developing apps in Ruby-on-Rails and at Command Line Interface level with a focus on maintainable DRY code.

##### Project Examples
| Project | Size of team | Description | Technologies |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Meal Planner (ADD LINK) |4| A Ruby-on-Rails app developed over 8 days that allows users to sign up, create recipes and make a 7 day meal plan | Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, PostgreSQL, CSS (Milligram), Rspec, Capybara, HTML |
| Dress 2 Impress (ADD LINK) | 5 | A Ruby-on-Rails app developed over 3.5 days that gives users the chance to have friends and family vote on their (sometimes dubious) fashion choices | Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, CSS (Bootstrap), Rspec, Capybara, HTML, Paperclip gem, Papercrop gem |
| Thermostatatic (ADD LINK) | 2 | A vanilla Javascript app to simulate the actions of a thermostat that consumes a weather API to display weather local to the user | Javascript, jQuery, Jasmine, CSS, HTML |
| Inglorius BnBstards (ADD LINK) | 4 | Air BnB clone ADD DETAILS | ADD DETAILS |

#### Communication and Teamwork

Completing the Makers Academy curicculum remotely and having worked as part of Global teams for the past five years in office and remote settings I have seen first hand how important effective communications skills are when developing and maintaining professional relationships with colleagues and clients. Being able to convey technical or complicated topics in a non-patronising way ensures everyone has the same understanding as you and minimises he liklihood of confusion/misunderstandings.

- Working on multiple Makers Academy project teams I collaborated effectively to ensure the project remained on focus by utilising Git, Waffle boards and daily standups
- I designed and delivered multiple webcasts to groups of senior Partners based around the world while working at EY in order to educate on the complex tax and immigration issues surrounding cross border working
