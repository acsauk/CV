## Alex Saunders

I'm a language agnostic web developer proudly trained at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) currently solving client problems at Bluetel Solutions.

Having partially completed a Computing BSc degree and fostering a life-long obsession for all things tech, I made the decision to switch from a successful career in Global Mobility and Cross Border compliance at EY to web development a couple of years back and I haven't looked back since.

I am looking for a role with a forward looking company that cares about the code they produce - somewhere where I can be stretched beyond my comfort zone, have an impact on a large scale and provide value wherever possible.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Web Development

I have gained a solid foundation in full stack object orientated programming and practice leading industry standards such as Test Driven Development (TDD), working as part of an Agile team and following SOLID principals when writing code.

Specifically I have experience of working in Ruby, Apex, PHP and Javascript developing apps in Ruby-on-Rails, React.js, Salesforce and at Command Line Interface level with a focus on maintainable DRY code.

##### Project Examples
| Project | Size of team | Description | Technologies |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Bank Transactions React.js App<br>[Github](https://github.com/acsauk/react_api) |1| React.js app developed over 4 days that consumes bank transaction data from an API | JavaScript, React.js, jQuery, MUIcss framework |
| Meal Planner<br>[Github](https://github.com/acsauk/meal_planner) \ [App](https://meal-planner-ma.herokuapp.com/) |Originally 4, now 1| Rails app originally developed as a Makers final group project but since gradually extended to start to target small food businesses that require a platform to store recipes, cost dishes and track inventory. | Rails, Javascript, PostgreSQL, SCSS (Milligram), Rspec, Capybara, HTML |
| Dress 2 Impress<br> [Github](https://github.com/jonnymoore12/dress_2_impress) \ [App](https://dress-2-impress-acsauk.herokuapp.com/dilemmas) | 5 | Rails app developed over 3.5 days that gives users the chance to have friends and family vote on their (sometimes dubious) fashion choices | Rails, Javascript, CSS (Bootstrap), Rspec, Capybara, HTML, Paperclip & Papercrop gems, PostgreSQL |
| Thermostatatic<br> [Github](https://github.com/acsauk/thermostat_js) | 2 | Vanilla Javascript app to simulate the actions of a thermostat that consumes a weather API to display weather local to the user | Javascript, jQuery, Jasmine, CSS, HTML |

#### Fast learner

- Starting Makers Academy, I had minimal experience of object orientated programming and had never coded in Ruby or JavaScript. After an intense 16 weeks I found I was comfortable in both languages and had developed the skills and frameworks to pick up new technologies/languages quickly.

- During my current role at Bluetel Solutions my time is split between multiple projects for a national energy company. The majority of my time is spent developing creative custom solutions to business challenges using the Salesforce platform coding in Apex and using SFDX for workflow. I have also spent some time working on a AWS Lambda codebase to implement a monitoring system for existing code. This was a first for me in regards to both the languages but I had submitted my first pull request within the first week to fix a UI bug that was preventing a team of 1000 from being able to carry out certain actions in the Salesforce environment.


#### Communication and Teamwork

- Being part of a team of 10 developers at Bluetel, working on multiple Makers Academy project teams and having worked as part of a Global team at EY in office and remote settings, I am experienced at building and maintaining relationships with colleagues and clients alike from a distance and face to face.

- I designed and delivered multiple webcasts to groups of senior Partners based around the world while working at EY in order to educate on the complex tax and immigration issues surrounding cross border working in an easy to understand format. 


#### Attention to detail

- Due to the nature of the workflow involved when working on Salesforce code I’ve further developed my attention to detail to ensure changes committed to Git are accurate and aren’t overwriting previous changes from other environments. 

- Feedback from other students on my Makers Academy cohort highlighted my attention to detail while pair programming, in particular providing alternative approaches to code structure and identifying syntax errors.

## Interests

Aside from coding I love long distance running and try to get through at least two half marathons a year. I'm an avid gamer with a fierce loyalty towards all things Nintendo (can't get enough of my Switch right now...) and I try to indulge my passion for live music whenever possible.
